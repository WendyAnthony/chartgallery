This is intended as a gallery / cookbook of different visualisation libraries in R. You can toggle overall code visibility in the top right-hand corner.

If you can improve the code or expand the charts or packages included, then please do so! [Go to repo](https://github.com/stephlocke/chartgallery)

# General packages {.tabset}
## Notes
The [ggvis gallery](ggvis.html) is currently seperate as it has an old version of the vega library resulting in problems with the vegalite package right now.

```{r ggplot2, child='ggplot2.Rmd'}
```

```{r vegalite, child='vegalite.Rmd'}
```

# Hygiene

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
