[Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega/) is a grammar of graphics implementation that takes JSON and converts the results to HTML5 or SVG. [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) provides layer over the top of Vega to reduce the burden of generating the JSON specifications required.

[Bob Rudis](http://rud.is/) developed an R binding of vegalite, currently available on github( [hrbrmstr/vegalite](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite) ). 

Much of the code used in this is taken from, or loosely based on, the code Bob wrote in [his reproduction](http://rud.is/projects/vegalite01.html) of the Vega gallery.
